# v0.0.20

- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed template literal syntax errors in esm.sh execution tests - replaced triple backslashes with clean string concatenation
- **UMD Bundle Fixes**: Resolved UMD bundle import issues by enhancing test methods to handle multiple import scenarios (module exports + global fallback)
- **Test Improvements**: Updated UMD tests to use v0.0.19 (where UMD bundle was actually created) instead of v0.0.17
- **Documentation**: All CDN import solutions now fully tested and working - esm.sh ‚≠ê, UMD Bundle, and Import Maps
- **Production Ready**: Complete CDN import solution with comprehensive test coverage and clean, maintainable code

# v0.0.19

- **CDN Import Solutions**: Implemented comprehensive CDN import solutions for ES6 module compatibility:
  - **esm.sh CDN** ‚≠ê (Recommended): Smart CDN with automatic ES6 dependency resolution - free for commercial use
  - **UMD Bundle** (`nagini.umd.js`): Universal module definition for maximum compatibility across all environments
  - **Import Maps**: Modern browser solution for fine-grained dependency control
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Added dedicated test suites for each CDN import method in scenery
  - **Documentation**: Created detailed comparison table and implementation guides for all solutions
- **Primary Solution**: esm.sh CDN chosen as the recommended approach for its simplicity and universal compatibility


# v0.0.18

- **Testing**: Added comprehensive CDN version and execution tests to the `scenery` test suite. These new tests validate that Nagini can be properly loaded and executed from the jsDelivr CDN, ensuring production readiness for CDN-based deployments.


# v0.0.17

- **CI/CD Fix**: Corrected the `requirements.txt` to properly install the imaging dependencies for the `mkdocs-material` social plugin. This resolves the final, persistent build error and ensures the documentation deploys successfully.

# v0.0.16

- **CI/CD Fix**: Corrected all deployment pathing issues for the GitHub Pages site. The interactive `scenery` test suite is now fully functional on the live documentation site.
- **Docs**: All hardcoded local URLs in the documentation have been replaced with relative paths for portability.
- **Stability**: This version marks the first stable release after the upgrade to Pyodide v0.28.0 and the resolution of all related deployment and testing issues.

> [!DANGER]
> Versions prior to `v0.0.16` are unstable.

# v0.0.15-unstable

- **CI/CD Fix**: Corrected the MkDocs deployment workflow by installing the necessary imaging dependencies (`mkdocs-material[imaging]`) for the social plugin. This resolves the final build error and ensures the documentation deploys successfully.

# v0.0.14-unstable

- **CI/CD**: Refactored the GitHub Pages deployment workflow to use a more robust, two-stage process. This resolves 404 errors for documentation pages by ensuring the entire `site` directory, including the `scenery` test application, is correctly deployed.
- **Docs**: Added links to the live documentation and interactive demos at the top of the `README.md` for easy access.

# v0.0.13-unstable

- **Upgrade**: Upgraded Pyodide to v0.28.0.
- **Fix**: Corrected Matplotlib integration to be compatible with Pyodide v0.28.0. The internal backend is now explicitly set to `agg` to ensure compatibility with the Web Worker environment, and font caching has been disabled to improve test stability.
- **Fix**: Resolved an issue where interactive test buttons in the `/scenery` application were unresponsive.
- **Documentation**: Added a new "Repository Reference" section to the documentation, providing a detailed file-by-file breakdown of the entire `src` directory.
- **Experiments**: Added a new `matplotlib-default` experiment to demonstrate the correct usage of Matplotlib within Nagini. Removed obsolete Matplotlib experiments.

# v0.0.12-unstable

- **Documentation**: Added a full documentation site with MkDocs, including a JSDoc-based API reference.
- **GitHub Actions**: Set up a new workflow to automatically build and deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages.

# v0.0.11-unstable

- **Fix**: Corrected a 404 error in the scenery application by removing an import for a non-existent `failure-tests.js` file.
- **README**: Added a prominent legend to clarify the branching model and production usage guidelines.
- **README**: Removed outdated information about `pre-push` hooks.




# v0.0.10-unstable

- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a critical bug where the asynchronous `input()` handling was broken. The `PyodideManager` was not correctly dequeuing and sending inputs to the worker, causing tests to fail and `input()` to return empty strings.
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for the interactive input system to `docs/docs.md` and both the root and worker `README.md` files to clarify the asynchronous flow and prevent future regressions.
- **Worker Bundle Update**: Rebuilt `worker-dist.js` to include the input handling fix.
