Please make sure all graphes are visible Very nice


But now, I want the colors of the graphs to change with light and dark

dont code immediately

of course all graphes will follow the same themes

but we will want them to be update 

i think just changing the css variables wby changing the data-theme will be enough (browser should do the rest ? no ?) 

Please
