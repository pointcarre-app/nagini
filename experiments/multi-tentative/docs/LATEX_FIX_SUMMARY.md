# LaTeX Rendering Fix Summary

## Problem
LaTeX elements in graphs were:
1. Missing backgrounds (transparent, hard to read)
2. Too big for their boxes
3. Not well positioned

## Root Cause
Foreign objects were using inline `style` strings like `"color: #503ab2"` which:
- Only set the text color
- Overrode the default CSS styles that provide background, padding, etc.
- Didn't work well with the style dictionary processing

## Solution

### 1. Updated Foreign Object Format
Changed from:
```python
{
    "style": "color: #503ab2",  # Only color, no background
}
```

To:
```python
{
    "bg_color": "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)",
    "text_color": "#503ab2",  # Proper background + color
}
```

### 2. Fixed Style Processing
- Modified `dict_from_graph_params` to parse style strings into dictionaries
- Ensured style dictionaries are properly converted to strings in SVG generation

### 3. Enhanced CSS Layout
Updated `.svg-latex` CSS to:
- Use flexbox for better centering
- Set proper box-sizing
- Ensure full width/height usage

## Files Changed

1. **graph1.py**: Converted all 3 foreign objects to use bg_color/text_color
2. **graph2.py**: Converted 2 foreign objects with complex styles
3. **svg_utils.py**: Fixed style string parsing in dict_from_graph_params
4. **test_graphs.html**: Enhanced CSS for better LaTeX positioning

## Result
- LaTeX now has proper white backgrounds with 90% opacity
- Text is correctly colored
- Elements are centered within their boxes
- Proper padding and border radius applied
