# New Educational Math Graphs Added

## Summary

- ✅ Cleaned up redundant `_v2` files (removed `graph6_v2.py` and `graph7_v2.py`)
- ✅ Added 4 new educational graphs showcasing SVG features and LaTeX annotations

## New Graphs

### Graph 10: Tangent Line to Parabola
- **Concept**: Derivatives and tangent lines
- **Features**:
  - Parabola f(x) = x²
  - Tangent line at x = 1.5 with slope calculation
  - Point of tangency highlighted
  - LaTeX annotations showing f(x), f'(x), and slope value
  - Color-coded elements (curve in pink, tangent in green)

### Graph 11: Definite Integral Visualization
- **Concept**: Integration and area under curves
- **Features**:
  - Function f(x) = 0.5x² + 1
  - Shaded area between bounds a and b
  - SVG path element for filled region
  - LaTeX showing integral notation and calculated value
  - Dashed vertical lines at integration bounds

### Graph 12: Unit Circle with Trigonometry
- **Concept**: Trigonometric functions and unit circle
- **Features**:
  - Perfect unit circle
  - Key angles marked with radius lines
  - Special points at (±1, 0) and (0, ±1)
  - LaTeX showing angle values (π/6, π/4, π/3)
  - Coordinate labels with exact trig values
  - Multiple colored elements for clarity

### Graph 13: Exponential and Logarithm Functions
- **Concept**: Inverse functions and their relationship
- **Features**:
  - e^x and ln(x) curves
  - Dashed y = x line showing reflection axis
  - Special points at (1, e), (e, 1), (0, 1), and (1, 0)
  - LaTeX annotations explaining inverse relationship
  - Value of e displayed
  - Color-coded functions (purple for exp, green for log)

## Educational Value

These graphs demonstrate:
1. **Advanced SVG features**: Paths, circles, dashed lines, filled areas
2. **Rich LaTeX annotations**: Fractions, integrals, Greek letters, superscripts
3. **Mathematical concepts**: Calculus (derivatives, integrals), trigonometry, exponentials
4. **Visual clarity**: Color coding, special points, reference lines
