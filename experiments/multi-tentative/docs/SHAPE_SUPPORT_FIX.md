# Shape Support Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeError with graphs 10-13
**Problem**: Graphs 10-13 were failing with `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'float'`

**Cause**: The line processing code in both `create_svg_scene` and `create_multi_curve_svg` was trying to process all elements in the `lines` array as simple lines with `x1, y1, x2, y2` properties. However, these graphs include:
- `type: "circle"` elements (with `cx, cy, r` properties)
- `type: "path"` elements (with `d` property)

**Solution**: Updated the line processing to check the element type and handle each appropriately:

```python
if line_type == "circle":
    # Handle circle elements
    circle_elem = dwg.circle(
        center=(transform_x(line.get("cx", 0)), transform_y(line.get("cy", 0))),
        r=line.get("r", 5),
        fill=line.get("fill", "none"),
        stroke=line.get("stroke", "black"),
        stroke_width=line.get("stroke-width", 1)
    )
    # ... add properties
    plot_group.add(circle_elem)

elif line_type == "path":
    # Handle path elements
    path_elem = dwg.path(
        d=line.get("d", ""),
        fill=line.get("fill", "none"),
        stroke=line.get("stroke", "black"),
        stroke_width=line.get("stroke-width", 1)
    )
    # ... add properties
    plot_group.add(path_elem)

else:
    # Default to line/axis handling
    # ... existing line code
```

### 2. KaTeX Positioning Improvements
**Problem**: LaTeX elements were not perfectly centered at their specified positions.

**Solution**: Enhanced the CSS styling for better centering:
- Added `margin: 0` to `.svg-latex` 
- Added `margin: 0 !important` and `vertical-align: middle !important` to KaTeX elements
- Added `line-height: 1 !important` to foreign object divs
- Ensured `.katex-display` has no margins

## Note on Path Coordinates
The path element in graph11 uses pre-computed coordinates. With the new g transform approach, these coordinates are now in the data space and will be properly transformed by the SVG group transform.

## Testing
Navigate to http://localhost:8010/experiments/multi-tentative/scenery/ to verify:
1. All 13 graphs should now render without errors
2. KaTeX labels should be better centered at their positions
