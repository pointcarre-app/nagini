ðŸ“Š Summary of What We've Accomplished:
Complete Bokeh Support for Nagini:
Core Integration âœ…
Added get_bokeh_figures() to Python capture system
Updated worker execution to capture Bokeh JSON
Modified PyodideManager to handle bokeh_figures in results
Rebuilt worker bundle with full Bokeh support
Interactive Examples âœ…
5 Static Examples: Line plots, scatter plots, linked subplots, dashboard, heatmap
Bidirectional Widget Demo: True interactive controls with parameter passing
All examples work both locally and on GitHub Pages
Key Features âœ…
JSON Export: Bokeh plots captured as JSON, preserving full interactivity
Multiple Plot Support: Can capture and render multiple figures
Layout Support: Grids, columns, rows, and complex layouts
Interactive Tools: Pan, zoom, hover, selection, reset - all working
Bidirectional Flow: JavaScript UI â†’ Python parameters â†’ Bokeh visualization
Documentation & Deployment âœ…
Updated GitHub Actions workflow to deploy examples
Created comprehensive demos showing different use cases
Fixed all issues (heatmap rendering, widget compatibility)
The Power of This Integration:
Users can now:
Run Python data analysis in the browser
Create interactive Bokeh visualizations
Build custom UIs with JavaScript that control Python execution
Deploy everything as static files (no server needed!)
This makes Nagini a powerful tool for:
ðŸ“ˆ Data dashboards
ðŸŽ“ Educational platforms
ðŸ”¬ Scientific computing demos
ðŸ“Š Business intelligence tools
ðŸŽ® Interactive data exploration
The combination of Pyodide + Nagini + Bokeh provides a complete Python data visualization stack that runs entirely in the browser! ðŸš€
Is there anything else you'd like to add or improve with the Bokeh integration?
