- [x] Better changelog

- [x] Clean docs and remove old files from old tentatives (like bundling with python)

- [ ] Clean the `/tests`  (templates / views)
    - [x] Find a way to do a two bird with one stone with `/scenery` (but careful, it requires a server for Flask)
    - [ ] do it the other way around; scenery has its own python environment and therefore can be safely eecetued after isntall any where (and it's not a dependency of nagini) 

    - [ ] git tag hook to ensure all tests in scenery made it

- [x] Implement brython in `src/brython/`
    - [x] Ensure Turtle is working
    - [x] write a test and maybe keep the draft statically in an /experiments folder ? 



- [ ] documents hooks  better 
    - [] one for tag: selenium/scenery based
    - [] one for commits (size of files)










- [] #low Consider adding support for `input()` with Brython Manager

- [] Add Licence buy button

- [] Update hooks for ensuring checking of ALL files at every commit

- [] decide about how to use scenery (externally - no install here) 
    - [] check the outputs in the table in `/scenery/index.html`
